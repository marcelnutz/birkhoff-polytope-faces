Code accompanying the paper "Monotonicity in Quadratically Regularized Linear Programs". The proof of Lemma 4.10 in that paper relies on this code, checking that all faces of the Birkhoff polytope (for marginal dimension up to 4) satisfy the following property: the minimum-norm point of the affine hull of the face is included in the face.
